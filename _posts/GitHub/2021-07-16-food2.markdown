- Learn how to code in React/Nodejs by writing a Recipe App.     
- Used [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to deploy and host content for testing.   
- Away to organized my list of cooking recipes and the ability to access the content when hosting the application on a server. 


## Starting the App
---
- yarn dev will spin up a front-end server and a back-end client running Express.      
```
yarn dev
```
```
"scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "serverNode": "node ./src/server.js",
    "server": "nodemon ./src/server.js",
    "client": "react-scripts start",
    "dev": "concurrently \"yarn server\" \"yarn client\"",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
```
   
#### Here is a list of fetures/functionalities:   
1. Easy navigation using material ui menu drawer/ material ui icons.   
2. Created a Search bar to filter recipes by title   
3. Designed an UI to display all food recipes.

Secion 1: Ingredients, Directions and Notes textfield area.     
Section 2: Additional Images using material ui carousel.

4. Created a Shopping List page when shopping at Costco, where user can add, delete and check off items.  
5. A Product Information page to keep track products pricing, location, seasonal (learn how to use material ui table)
6. Created a form input page to add new recipes. User create, remove, update and delete recipes.  
- There are no required form inputs inorder for the user to add a new recipe   
- Note form validation have not been implemented   
- The textbox for Misc Images (comma separated) is used for displaying images in the carousel   
- The textbox for Video (comma separated) is used for display videos in the carousel
